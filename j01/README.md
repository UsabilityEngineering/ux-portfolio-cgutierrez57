## My UX experience with the Steam Deck

I recently started using this portable gaming device/linux pc on my free time at home. The device is unique in that since its not a closed ecosystem device designed specifically for gaming. Because of that it has a bit of a learn and curve when installing applications interacting with them with the built in controls.

Most of the time games and other software is mapped pretty well and the integration of a track pad for mouse controls gives a wider range of options available to the user. Increasingly so with the adition of a second one either for some alternate use or potentially for users who are left handed.
sometimes for users starting a new application, espeically ones that were not yet tested for compatibility or designed for the device in mind mapping issues can occur and layouts can be a little wonky.
For new users and for those who are trying to look for an easy solution, there are templates provided that allow for usage in certain control schemes. Applications designed for the device in mind will have official control schemes approved by the developers for what they think is the best to use and the community of users can even upload there own templates for others to use and enjoy how they see fit. all of which are tabbed and separated accordingly.

For experienced users the device allows you to re-map everything however you see fit for it to be the most optimal experience for yourself.
